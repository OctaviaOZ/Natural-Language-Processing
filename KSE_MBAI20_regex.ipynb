Ad hoc polymorphism was a feature of Algol [digits], while parametric polymorphism was the core feature of ML\\'s type system.',\n"," 'In a [digits] paper, Peter Wegner and Luca Cardelli introduced the term inclusion polymorphism to model subtypes and inheritance,[[digits]] citing Simula as the first programming language to implement it.',\n"," 'In dynamically typed languages the situation can be more complex as the correct function that needs to be invoked might only be determinable at run time.',\n"," 'Parametric polymorphism allows a function or a data type to be written generically, so that it can handle values uniformly without depending on their type.[[digits]] Parametric polymorphism is a way to make a language more expressive while still maintaining full static type-safety.',\n"," 'The concept of parametric polymorphism applies to both data types and functions. A function that can evaluate to or be applied to values of different types is known as a polymorphic function. A data type that can appear to be of a generalized type (e.g. a list with elements of arbitrary type) is designated polymorphic data type like the generalized type from which such specializations are made.',\n"," 'John C. Reynolds (and later Jean-Yves Girard) formally developed this notion of polymorphism as an extension to lambda calculus (called the polymorphic lambda calculus or System F). Any parametrically polymorphic function is necessarily restricted in what it can do, working on the shape of the data instead of its value, leading to the concept of parametricity.',\n"," 'In another example, if Number, Rational, and Integer are types such that Number\\xa0:>\\xa0Rational and Number\\xa0:>\\xa0Integer, a function written to take a Number will work equally well when passed an Integer or Rational as when passed a Number. The actual type of the object can be hidden from clients into a black box, and accessed via object identity.',\n"," 'In fact, if the Number type is abstract, it may not even be possible to get your hands on an object whose most-derived type is Number (see abstract data type, abstract class). This particular kind of type hierarchy is known‚Äîespecially in the context of the Scheme programming language‚Äîas a numerical tower, and usually contains many more types.',\n"," 'The same goes for most other popular object systems. Some, however, such as Common Lisp Object System, provide multiple dispatch, under which method calls are polymorphic in all arguments.',\n"," 'The interaction between parametric polymorphism and subtyping leads to the concepts of variance and bounded quantification.',\n"," 'Row polymorphism is a similar, but distinct concept from subtyping. It deals with structural types.  It allows the usage of all values whose types have certain properties, without losing the remaining type information.',\n"," 'Polymorphism can be distinguished by when the implementation is selected: statically (at compile time) or dynamically (at run time, typically via a virtual function). This is known respectively as static dispatch and dynamic dispatch, and the corresponding forms of polymorphism are accordingly called static polymorphism and dynamic polymorphism.',\n"," 'Static polymorphism executes faster, because there is no dynamic dispatch overhead, but requires additional compiler support. Further, static polymorphism allows greater static analysis by compilers (notably for optimization), source code analysis tools, and human readers (programmers). Dynamic polymorphism is more flexible but slower‚Äîfor example, dynamic polymorphism allows duck typing, and a dynamically linked library may operate on objects without knowing their full type.',\n"," 'Static polymorphism typically occurs in ad hoc polymorphism and parametric polymorphism, whereas dynamic polymorphism is usual for subtype polymorphism. However, it is possible to achieve static polymorphism with subtyping through more sophisticated use of template metaprogramming, namely the curiously recurring template pattern.',\n"," 'System F for a lambda calculus with parametric polymorphism.']"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":191}]},{"metadata":{"id":"Zeo7gMzNT4Xm","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### The regular expression is a highly helpful tool to pre-process text data.
